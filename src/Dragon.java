 In this game, the player is in a land full of dragons. The dragons all live in caves with their large piles of collected
  treasure. Some dragons are friendly and share their treasure. Other dragons are hungry and eat anyone who enters their
  cave. The player approaches two caves, one with a friendly dragon and the other with a hungry dragon, but doesnâ€™t know
   which dragon is in which cave. The player must choose between the two.
